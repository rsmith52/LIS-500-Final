      <h1>
        Kaoru Ro's Personal Course/Project Reflection
      </h1>
      <p>LIS 500 is the first online class I took in UW-Madison, so the remote-paired programming session is also new and challenging for me because sometimes it is extremely difficult to communicate efficiently and clearly with remote partners through social media and other online tools. The first remote-paired assignment in this course was relatively easy because it was just introducing each other. However, when it comes to the second assignment where my partners and I have to create websites together, it was challenging because we could not communicate in a clear and efficient manner, and everyone was confused about the assignment itself. Therefore, we wanted to meet face to face to finish the assignment together. Nevertheless, one of my partners lives outside of Madison and could not make it to our meeting, so only one of my partner and I were able to meet and collaborate together for the group homepage part. We finished the whole assignment in quite short time, but we struggled to upload our assignment to the raroyston.org for a long time since we were extremely confused about the instructions on the lecture. Therefore, I think it would be helpful if the instructions for uploading assignments can be clearer through video.</p>

      <p>On the other hand, the course material including how to make websites through html, css, and php was useful and can become one of the skills I obtain through the course and I can employ in my future career. Among all the ways we learned to create websites, I think php was the most difficult part in the lecture and where I struggled the most because I have never actually learned it before, but it was also the most interesting part of the course due to its functions. Even though the use of php in the final project was relatively challenging for me, creating a website survey was meaningful and successful for me because it was my first time creating a website that can truly work for a purpose. </p>

      <p>Not only the useful course material related to website coding, but the issues of diversity and inclusion that we discussed in the course were also meaningful and thoughtful. As a minority myself, I believe inclusion is the most important issue we are facing in college and also in the society as a whole. Consequently, it is extremely significant for students since college or even earlier to be aware of the issues, advocate for diversity, and act to be inclusive. Through all the discussions we had throughout the course, I learned different perspectives on such issues and what we can do to solve those issues. Since the course focuses on website coding, it was my first time actually learning the issues of diversity and inclusions specifically in the technology field. I realized how women and the minorities of races are treated differently and limited to develop their career in the technology world, and I think such phenomenon should be changed by minorities speaking for themselves in the short term and education for the long term. </p>

      <p>In conclusion, the course overall was extremely useful for both its coding materials and discussions about the issues of diversity and inclusions. On the other hand, something that was challenging for me is the remote-paired programming session. In addition, I would like to suggest for a more clearer instruction of how to upload the assignments in the future. </p>
