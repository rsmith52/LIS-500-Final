      <h1>
        Ray Smith's Personal Course/Project Reflection
      </h1>
      <p>I have worked on dozens of group projects in college classes including many programming projects for Computer Science classes. Because of this, pair programming is not a new concept to me, though PHP and SQL were new, and one of the main reasons I took this class was to learn them. Throughout the semester working with a partner remotely definitely made things harder. I found having a consistent form of communication, such as Slack helps make sure partners are on the same page with what work is planned to be done and makes asking questions easy. Using an online repository through GitHub that is updated whenever code is changed makes everything much easier, so we don’t have to worry about uploading over each other’s work directly to the course web page and can see each change the other person made.</p>

      <p>For the final project, I think our group was lucky to all be undergrads on campus, so we didn’t have to worry much about the remote part of the assignment. We were all able to get together to work on the project at the same time. I wanted to focus mostly on the code, and was more interested in hearing what my partners, Fran and Carly, thought of as a good topic for our survey. We worked together with different focuses, and Fran also had a Computer Science background so was familiar with programming which made the overall process of coding the site pretty easy.</p>

      <p>In general working on these coding projects was made a lot easier by having templates and examples to base our code off of. Resources like W3Schools are great, but not nearly as helpful as the PHP assignment before the final where everyone submitted a question. Using the PHP in those pages as a reference and starting point was much nicer than having to do outside research and start from scratch to figure out what is needed for this type of site.</p>

      <p>I have mixed feelings when it comes to doing project work in general. I usually keep pretty high standards for myself and the quality of work I want to turn in and have had partners in past projects who disagree with the importance of those standards. Those are hard situations to deal with, since I know the state of the project could be improved, but don’t want to just take over or redo the work and spark a conflict with the other person/people. I am happy to say I was very satisfied with the quality of work and care everyone I worked with in this class put forward. Working with Madde on earlier projects was very nice as she could be counted on to do her portion of the project and do a good job with it, going above with changing styles to make the page look better. Fran and Carly came up with most of the questions for our survey and did a great job structuring it, deciding to keep the questions consistent and focused, from the more scattered start we had.</p>

      <p>I think that group projects and projects work just gets better in higher level classes, as everyone here is here for personal interest and has a higher stake in the course as it is focused more in the area they want to work in, or they wouldn’t be taking the course. This course’s projects have given me a more positive outlook on projects in my last year of undergrad, and after that if I pursue graduate school and the “real world”.</p>
