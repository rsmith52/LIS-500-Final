      <h1>
        Group Reflection on Survey Results
      </h1>
      <p>In the following review, we will discuss our group’s analysis on the final project for LIS 500, Code and Power. We formulated the questions primarily as a group, choosing one topic to center them around. We centered ours around implicit gender bias, specifically having to do with clothing and body image. After coming up with numerous questions individually, we consolidated our lists into one, coherent question list. This included finding the right ordering for the questions, rewording some in order to make the survey more uniform, and eliminating the questions that didn’t quite fit our theme. Throughout the rest of this review we will discuss the data that was collected on our survey questions. </p>

      <p>We started the survey with some personal questions for the user to answer, in order to collect some background data on who was taking it. For this part of our survey, we asked about preferred gender pronouns, age, and ethnicity. </p>

      <p>The preferred gender pronouns question was one of the most unanswered questions. We expected this and are glad we included a ‘no response’ option. We had a 5:3 ratio of she/her/hers to he/him/his. Based on the class list, if more users were to take the survey, we would expect the ratio to weigh even more towards she/hers/hers. There was one individual who self-identified with they/them/theirs and one who self-identified with other. This last response, as well as the users who chose no response, might have identified with something else if we had included more options or pgp’s.  </p>

      <p>Everyone who took our survey answered the age question. The age distribution was exactly as we had expected, which was between the range of 18-34. We expected this due to the general ages of students on campus, as well as the mix of undergrads and graduate students taking this class. </p>

      <p>Our question on ethnicity self-identification was another question that got a quite a few answers of ‘no response’. We tried to be as inclusive as possible with this question, listing all the major groups we felt were necessary. The majority of people taking the survey identified as white, while a few others identified as Asian/Pacific Islander. One user identified under mixed ethnicity. We tried to have the option of checking more than one answer here, but in the end felt that for the sake of our results page, it was best to leave the user only the option of clicking one response. </p>

      <p>The rest of our questions followed the theme of clothing and body image within the topic of gender. Our scale had 5 as strongly agree and 1 as strongly disagree, with no response set to the value of 0. We then used these numbers to find the average response for each question. Because we knew our classmates would be ones taking this survey, we expected pretty low bias for most of the answers. For the most part, that is what we got in our responses. </p>

      <p>Our first three question ask about how individuals feel about the outer attractiveness of men and women. Most people do not show bias toward muscular women being unattractive, with an average score of 1.9. In contrast, preference was shown towards finding muscular males to be attractive, with an average score of 3.4. A similar preference to taller men over shorter men was found, with an average score of 3.3. This could be a reflection of possible toxic masculinity in modern society. </p>

      <p>The next two questions ask about masculinity and femininity associated with different sports. Most people showed little bias towards associating basketball with masculinity, with an average response of 1.4. Our question about associating volleyball with femininity showed similar results with an average response of 1.5. </p>

      <p>For both question number 6 and 7, the results were surprising for us because more people voted on disagree for viewing skinny women as more attractive than those who are overweight and skinny men as less masculine than muscular men than those who voted agree. This demonstrates how the majority cares less about female and male’s body size. What even more surprised us are the results from question 8 to 10 that almost every participants disagreed on the view that skirts, drop earrings, and make up are women’s things that other gender groups should not wear. Such results showed how majority of the participants believe in gender equality how everyone has the right to wear anything regardless of their potential “female” features. </p>

      <p>Such unbiased perspectives of the majority continued in question 11 and 12 where they think that man can wear thigh-length shorts without being less masculine and woman can also wear something other than dresses and heels during formal ceremonies to show their female features. However, in question 13, even though the majority still thinks that men do not have to only wear suits during formal ceremonies, there are few participants who think that men should in this case, where they might have an unintended bias towards suits as a “man” clothing during formal ceremonies. On the other hand, the question 14 still successfully shows how the majority of the participants disagree on men not caring their appearance as much as other gender groups do, indicating their unbiased belief on how men can also care about their appearance without any restrictions.</p>

      <p>The last question in the survey is different from other questions where we focus on how people can make effort to eliminate their bias towards different genders, and the result of the question was as what we expected that most of the participants agreed on the suggestion that people should make more of an effort to use gender neutral terms in daily conversation to avoid assuming gender identity based off of appearance. </p>

      In conclusion, all results from all the questionnaires we had in our survey demonstrate how most of the participants do not hold biased perspectives towards different genders. They are relatively inclusive for any appearances of any genders and think that everyone has the right to do anything they want regardless of their genders. In addition, they believe that we should make an effort to avoid the disrespect of assuming incorrect gender identities in order to make the world a more inclusive and diverse place. </p>
