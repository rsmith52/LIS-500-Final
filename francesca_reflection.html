        Francesca Tyler's Personal Course/Project Reflection
      </h1>
      <p>The experience of paired programming was not new to me this semester. As a computer science major, I’ve experienced this in almost all of my classes. It’s always somewhat of a challenge when you start to work with a new partner, because you have to navigate figuring out how the other person or people write their code and how it can fit into your own personal style. </p>

      <p>Project work in general is the same way. Growing up I feel as if my instructors were constantly trying to prepare their students for group work, and I’m glad I had this experience. It has helped me constantly throughout my college career, as most classes I’ve taken require at least some partner or group work. Again, projects are always a challenge with multiple people because of the different styles, ideas, preferences, etc. that people have. Working together to figure out how everyone’s personal twist can fit together is part of the challenge and part of the fun of group work. </p>

      <p>Remote-paired programming was a new experience for me this semester. It was probably the most challenging part of this course. Because this was an online class, we couldn’t guarantee that every member of our group would be in Madison to meet up in person. My group in all but the final project had one member who would call in to meet with us. Doing this with programming made it very difficult to sync up our code and accurately convey our ideas. With the first code project we had, creating a tech hero website, the points that my group lost were in the lack of fluidity and similar style between our individual pages. This likely could have been avoided if we were meeting up in person, but I’m glad to have had the experience of remote-paired programming. </p>

      <p>In my final group for the final project, every member was in Madison as a full-time student at the university. This made meeting up in person on a regular basis much easier. Our code was more fluid and uniform, and we were able to use GitHub to easily share files. One of my partners for this was also studying computer science, which made programming easier. Overall, I much prefer working with people in person versus over the phone or a skype call. </p>

      <p>The final project helped me to put into practice all of what we learned over the course of this past semester. It was intriguing to see how bias forms so easily based on pop culture and the views of modern society as a whole. It was also interesting to fight back the initial bias to form more inclusive thoughts and try to help others do the same. Being more aware of what your implicit biases are is the first step towards correcting them if need be. Reading about “code” and “power” and how they relate was a way of thinking about code that was different from anything I had learned before. I like knowing that code projects such as this one can help empower others to be more aware of their own self views. </p>
